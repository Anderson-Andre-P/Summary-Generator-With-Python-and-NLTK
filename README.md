# Summary Generator With Python and NLTK

This algorithm was developed in Python using the NLTK library, it is capable of generating a summary from a given text.

It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify the most important phrases in the text and generate a concise and informative summary.

The process begins with cleaning the text, removing punctuation marks and special characters, and then tokenizing the text, separating it into phrases and words. After that, methods of analyzing the frequency and relevance of words are applied, identifying the most important ones for the summary.

Finally, the most relevant sentences of the text are selected, taking into account the importance of the words contained in each one of them. The selected phrases are then combined to generate the final summary.

Using this algorithm, it is possible to obtain a concise and accurate summary of a text, saving time and effort in reading and understanding important information.
