            "Resumo:   Ann R Coll Surg Engl Artificial intelligence AI is defined as a field of science and engineering concerned with the computational understanding of what is commonly called intelligentbehaviour and with the creation of artefacts that exhibitsuch behaviour Aristotle attempted to formalise right thinking logic through his syllogisms a three partdeductive reasoning Much of the work in the modern erawas inspired by this and the early studies on the operationof mind helped to establish contemporary logical thinkingPrograms which enable computers to function in the waysthat make people seem intelligent are called artificialintelligent systems The British mathematician Alan Turing was one of the founders of modern computer scienceand AI He defined intelligent behaviour in a computer asthe ability to achieve humanlevel performance in cognitive tasks this later became popular as the Turing test Since the middle of the last century researchers have explored thepotential applications of intelligent techniques in every fieldof medicine The application of AI technology in the field of surgery was first successively investigated by Gunn in when he explored the possibility of diagnosing acuteabdominal pain with computer analysis The last two decades have seen a surge in the interest in medical AI Modern medicine is faced with the challenge of acquiring analysing and applying the large amount ofknowledge necessary to solve complex clinical problemsThe development of medical artificial intelligence hasbeen related to the development of AI programs intendedArtificial intelligence in medicine AN Ramesh C Kambhampati JRT Monson PJ Drew The University of Hull Academic Surgical Unit Castle Hill Hospital Cottingham UK Department of Computer Science University of Hull UK Introduction Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science capable of analysing complex medical data Their potential to exploit meaningful relationship with in a data set can be used inthe diagnosis treatment and predicting outcome in many clinical scenariosMethods Medline and internet searches were carried out using the keywords artificial intelligence and neural networks computer Further references were obtained by crossreferencing from key articles An overview of different artificial intelligent techniques is presentedin this paper along with the review of important clinical applicationsResults The proficiency of artificial intelligent techniques has been explored in almost every field of medicine Artificial neural network was the most commonly used analytical tool whilst otherartificial intelligent techniques such as fuzzy expert systems evolutionary computation and hybridintelligent systems have all been used in different clinical settingsDiscussion Artificial intelligence techniques have the potential to be applied in almost every field of medicine There is need for further clinical trials which are appropriately designed before theseemergent techniques find application in the real clinical setting Key words Artificial intelligence Neural networks computer Correspondence to Mr PJ Drew Academic Surgical Unit Castle Hill

networks ANNsfuzzy expert systems evolutionary computation andhybrid intelligent systems Artificial neural networks Judging by the volume of publication in the last two decades ANN is the most popular AI technique inmedicine ANNs are computational analytical tools which are inspired by the biological nervous system They consistof networks of highly interconnected computer processorscalled neurons that are capable of performing parallelcomputations for data processing and knowledgerepresentation Their ability to learn from historical examples analyse nonlinear data handle impreciseinformation and generalise enabling application of themodel to independent data has made them a very attractiveanalytical tool in the field of medicine McCulloch and Pitts invented the first artificial neurone using simple binary threshold functions The next important milestone came when Frank Rosenblatt apsychologist developed the Perceptron in as a practical model Many variations of the basic Perceptronnetwork have been proposed but the most popular modelhas been multilayer feedforward Perceptron Fig Thesenetworks are made up of layers of neurons typically aninput layer one or more middle or hidden layers and anoutput layer each of which are fully connected to otherlayer The neurons are connected by links and each link hasa numerical weight associated with it A neural networklearns through repeated adjustments of these weights Oneof the important characters of ANNs is that they can learnfrom their experience in a training environment The use ofmultilayer feedforward Perceptron was restricted by thelack of a suitable learning algorithm until Paul Werbos a PhD student introduced backpropagationlearning Some of the other popular network designs include Hopfield networks Radial Basis Function and the SelfOrganizing Feature Map ANNs have already found a wide variety of applications in the real world Their ability to classify and recognisepatterns accurately has attracted researchers to apply themin solving many clinical problems As we realise thatdiagnosis treatment and predicting outcome in manyclinical situations is dependent on a complex interaction ofmany clinical biological and pathological variables there is agrowing need for analytical tools like ANNs which canexploit the intricate relationships between these variablesBaxt was one of the first researchers to explore the clinical potentials of ANNs He developed a neural network model which accurately diagnosed acute myocardial infarction andlatter prospectively validated his work with similaraccuracy Since then ANNs have been applied in almost every field of medicine Diagnosis ANNs have been used in the clinical diagnosis image analysis in radiology and histopathology data interpretation in intensive care setting and waveform analysis Stamey et al developed a neural network derived classification algorithm called ProstAsure Index which canclassify prostates as benign or malignant This model whichwas subsequently validated in prospective studies had adiagnostic accuracy of with a sensitivity of andspecificity of Some of the other surgically relevantdiagnostic applications of ANNs include abdominal painand appendicitis retained common bile duct stones glaucoma and back pain ANNs have also been used in diagnosing cytological and histological specimens PAPNET a computerisedautomated

diagnose myocardial infarction atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrythmias Analysis of electroenchalograms EEG by neural networks has led to itsapplication in the diagnosis of epilepsy and sleep

extremely important in planning appropriate treatment strategies and followup Accurateidentification of highrisk patients may facilitate targetedaggressive adjuvant therapy which may help cure thedisease and prolong survival ANNs with their ability toexploit nonlinear relations between variables areparticularly suitable to analyse complex cancer data It hasbeen demonstrated that neural

severity of illness scoring system Fuzzy expert systems Fuzzy logic is the science of reasoning thinking and inference that recognises and uses the real worldphenomenon that everything is a matter of degree Insteadof assuming everything is black and white conventionallogic fuzzy logic recognises that in reality most thingswould fall somewhere in between that is varying shades ofgrey It was popularised by Lofti Zadeh an engineerfrom the University of California It uses continuous set membership from to in contrast to Boolean orconventional logic which uses sharp distinctions ie for false and for true Medicine is essentially a continuousdomain and most medical data is inherently imprecise Fuzzy logic is a data handling methodology that permitsambiguity and hence is particularly suited to medicalapplications It captures and uses the concept of fuzziness ina computationally effective manner Zadeh wrote in that the most likely area of application for this theory lies inmedical diagnostics and to a lesser extent in the descriptionof biological systems Fuzzy expert systems have the structure of a series of if then rules for modelling Fig The techniques of fuzzy logic have been explored in many medical applications Schneider et al showed that fuzzy logic performed better than multiple logisticregression analysis in diagnosing lung cancer using tumour marker profiles Similarly the application of fuzzy logic hasbeen explored in the diagnosis of acute leukaemia and breast and pancreatic cancer They have also been applied to characterise ultrasound images of the breast ultrasound and CT scan images of liver lesions and MRI images of brain tumours Fuzzy logic has also been used topredict survival in patients with breast cancer Fuzzy controllers have been designed for the administration ofvasodilators to control blood pressure in the perioperativeperiod They have also been used for the administration of anaesthetics in the operating room Evolutionary computation Evolutionary computation is the general term for several computational techniques based on natural evolutionprocess that imitates the mechanism of natural selectionand survival of the fittest in solving realworld problemsThe most widely used form of evolutionary computationfor medical applications are Genetic AlgorithmsProposed by John Holland they are a class of stochastic search and optimisation algorithms based onnatural biological evolution They work by creating manyrandom solutions to the problem at hand This populationof many solutions will then evolve from one generation tothe next ultimately arriving at a satisfactory solution tothe problem The best solutions are added to thepopulation while the inferior ones are eliminated Byrepeating this process among the better elements repeated improvements will occur in the population survive and generate new solutions Most medical decisions can be formulated as a search in a very large and complex space For example acytologist analysing a cytological specimen to decidewhether they are malignant or not is searching in thespace of all possible cell features for a set of featurespermitting him to provide a clear diagnosis Geneticalgorithms exploit the mechanism of natural evolution tosearch efficiently in a given space They are applied toperform several types of tasks like diagnosis andARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE RAMESH Ann R Coll Surg Engl Figure A typical fuzzy rule systemprognosis medical imaging and signal processing and planning and scheduling The principles of Geneticalgorithms have been used to predict outcome in criticallyill patients lung cancer melanoma and response to warfarin They have also been used in computerised analysis of mammographic microcalcification MRI segmentation of brain tumours to measure the efficacy oftreatment strategies and for analysing computerised D images to diagnose malignant melanomas Hybrid intelligent systems Each AI technique has its own strengths and weaknesses Neural networks are mainly concerned with learning fuzzylogic with imprecision and evolutionary computation withsearch and optimisation The advantages of these technologiescan be combined together to produce hybrid intelligentsystems which can work in a complementary manner Theirsynergy allows a hybrid system to accommodate commonsense extract knowledge from raw data use humanlikereasoning mechanisms deal with uncertainty and impre cision and learn to adapt to a rapidly changing and unknownenvironment There are many different hybrid systemsavailable and the popular ones are ANNs for designing fuzzysystems fuzzy systems for designing ANNs and GeneticAlgorithms for automatically training and generating neuralnetwork architectures Once again the application of hybridintelligent systems has been explored in many diverse clinicalscenarios Some examples include breast cancer diagnosis analysis of microcalcification on digital mammograms diagnosis of coronary artery stenosis assessment of myocardial viability and control of the depth of anaesthesia Conclusions There are many different AI techniques available which are capable of solving a variety of clinical problems However inspite of earlier optimism medical AI technology has notbeen embraced with enthusiasm One reason for this is theattitude of the clinicians towards technology being used inthe decisionmaking process Paradoxically there is noqualm in accepting the biochemical results generated froman autoanalyser or images produced by magneticresonance imaging However it is the obligation of researchers active in this field to produce evidence that these techniques work on a practical level The need to undertakemore randomised controlled studies to prove the efficacy ofAI systems in medicine is therefore vital There is compelling evidence that medical AI can play a vital role in assisting the clinician to deliver health careefficiently in the st century There is little doubt that thesetechniques will serve to enhance and complement themedical intelligence of the future clinicianReferences Shapiro SC Artificial intelligence In Shapiro SC ed Encyclopedia of Artificial
